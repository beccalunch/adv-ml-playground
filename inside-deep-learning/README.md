# Deep Learning Walkthrough
I've dabbled with DL tools before but never via any formal learning, so I'll be stepping through Edward Raff's book _Inside Deep Learning_ with a notebook for each chapter, to keep as my own personal reference.

A lot of this is refresher material, but it will be nice to have it all covered in one place.
